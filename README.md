State Education Spending Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive statistical analysis of state spending on public education, teacher salaries, SAT participation rates, and population metrics. The analysis was performed using R programming, with a focus on key educational and financial indicators across different states.

Project Overview
The project aims to explore the relationships between various educational metrics and financial data, providing insights into how state spending impacts public education and student performance. Key analyses include:

State Spending on Public Education per Student
-Minimum, maximum, mean, and median values.
-Variability across different regions.

Teacher Salaries
-Analysis of average teacher salaries across states.
-Correlation between salaries and student performance metrics.

SAT Participation Rates
-Central tendency analysis for the percentage of high-school students taking the SAT exam.
-Correlation with state education spending and teacher salaries.

State Population Metrics
-Analysis of population size across states and its impact on educational outcomes.

Key Features
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides summary statistics and visualizations of key variables, including bell curves and box plots.
-ANOVA Testing: One-Way ANOVA tests to determine whether spending on public education varies significantly by region.
-Correlation and Regression Analysis:
  Correlation tests between SAT participation, teacher salaries, and public education spending.
  Simple linear regression models to assess relationships between variables.
-Normality Testing: Shapiro-Wilk, Anderson-Darling, and Pearson chi-square tests are used to assess the normality of key data distributions.

Technologies Used
-R Programming: For statistical analysis and data visualization.
-RStudio IDE: For conducting detailed analyses and generating graphs.
